# Spotify App 🚀

This repository is part of a set of exercises that I have done in the context of Fernando Herrera's Advanced Angular courses.
This project is an application that uses the Spotify API and works as an application for searching and listening to music.

To be able to use the application you have to clone the repository to local and to run it:
* npm install
* ng serve

## Build with 🛠️

* Angular 9
* RXJS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Typescript
